<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>Next month is the end of my 3rd semester at UIUC. After that I will only have one more semester left, and I will graduate this August.</p>

<p>Being an online graduate student, as well as a full-time software developer has been extremely challenging. The all-nighters, constant flow of assignments, and difficult coursework have really put me to the test. Regardless, I have been able to pull through so far, and I’m confident that I will finish strong this semester and in the upcoming one as well.</p>

<p>Last October I also got monetized on YouTube! It was really fun to grow my community and make detailed guides and analysis videos for mobile games. Unfortunately, the game I was covering shut down this month, which put a stop to a lot of my plans moving forward in regards to the channel. Regardless, I will eventually return, and I already have some good ideas for what content I will create in the future.</p>

<p>Additionally, my work responsibilities have increased with the new project that I’m on. It has been great as it has been full-stack work, meaning I’ve learned a lot about system design, front-end, and back-end standards and technologies. I feel like I’m slowly coming into my own as a developer, and I’m looking forward to the future and improving my skills and mastery of different domains related to web-development and data science.</p>

<p>That’s all for this update, thank you for reading and good luck with your own endeavors!</p>
