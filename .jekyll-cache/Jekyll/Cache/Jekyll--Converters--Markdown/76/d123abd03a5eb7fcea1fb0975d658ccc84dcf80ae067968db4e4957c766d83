<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The Academy Awards, or the Oscars, is the most influential award show in the movie industry where best films of the year are awarded since 1929 (Zauzmer, 2020). Every year, cinephiles and general movie fans all over the world tune in to witness the awards being given out. Predicting the Oscars has also become very popular among movie fans. On the largest prediction site, Gold Derby, there are more than 10,000 users trying to predict the final winners every year.
This year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film industry is facing unprecedented challenges.</p>

<p>Firstly, there are less blockbuster movies coming out this year due to boxoffice concerns. Looking at this year’s Best Picture nominees, the only “normal” Oscar movies are Mank and The Trial of the Chicago 7. The other six nominees are low-budget independent movies, which are mostly likely not gonna be nominated in a normal year.</p>

<p>Second, the awards season had been prolonged, with the Oscars awards ceremony being postponed to be held on April 25th.</p>

<p>Most importantly, because of the pandemic, all awards season screening had been held online instead of in-person. Many Oscar voters have complained openly because they cannot enjoy the screening in theaters and they cannot converse with other members and get to know their opinions. All these changes have made this year’s Oscar race more unpredictable than ever.</p>

<p>To predict the winners, there are a variety of factors to take into consideration, which we will briefly introduce in the background section. Considering that social media can influence public and private opinions about these nominated movies, in this project, we investigated whether we can use twitter sentiment scores to predict the winners. Since the most talked-about Oscar categories on twitter are Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, we will limit our prediction scope to these five main categories.</p>
