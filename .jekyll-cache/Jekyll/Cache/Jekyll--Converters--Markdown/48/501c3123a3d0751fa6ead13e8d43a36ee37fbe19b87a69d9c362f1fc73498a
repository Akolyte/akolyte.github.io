<p>Growing up I always had a fascination with technology, and I had many opportunities to engage with that interest through my participation in the Technology Student Assocation (TSA). I also participated in many other extracurriculurs, including piano, taekwondo, boy scouts, cross country, and choir.</p>

<p>These interests eventually lead to my love for programming, and my career in Data Science. After learning more about the domain, I loved the problem solving part of the job (such as fine tuning machine learning techniques, predictive modeling, visualizations, etc.), and I decided that was the career I wanted to pursue.</p>

<p>In June 2018 I interned over the summer for a startup called Visionese based in State College, PA as an IT intern. They had previously dealt with creating virtual reality tours of different spaces, but they were transitioning to office spaces as a service in different cities. My role was to get their website up and running, and update it on a regular basis through feedback from my manager.</p>

<p>The next summer in June 2019 I interned at M&amp;T bank as a technology intern. I was placed in a database administration department, and I spent my day to day writing PowerShell scripts to automate database administration tasks. I also worked together with another group in the company to create a training module for Neo4j, as group wanted to start using in their work, but wanted to teach it in a banking context. In order to become more familiar with scrum methodologies I also worked with another team in their scrum meetings, and together we presented a piece of software to senior leadership at the end of the internship. There we placed 3rd out of 22 groups participating at the time.</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/graduation2.JPG" alt="graduation" /></p>

<p>In May 2021 I graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science from Penn State‚Äôs College of Information Sciences and Technology. Along the way I met and got to know many great peers and professors who helped me explore my interests in statistics and data science.</p>

<p>My degree was an ‚ÄúApplied‚Äù option of the data science program, meaning that there was a greater focus on building models and applications throughout my coursework. Therefore I have a lot of hands on experience with building data science applications, models, and data cleaning with real-life datasets.</p>

<p>Currently I am working at General Motors as a Software Developer in Warren, Michigan. In my spare time I‚Äôm trying my best to go out and get to know lots of new people and work on myself professionally, whether that be through developing this website, or creating applications relevant to my interests in statistical analysis and data science.</p>

<h1 id="pursuing-my-masters-degree---uiuc">Pursuing my Masters Degree - UIUC</h1>

<p><img src="/imgs/grainger.jpg" alt="uiuc" /></p>

<p>Right now I am currently pursuing my Masters Degree at UIUC! I am enrolled in the Online Masters of Computer Science program at UIUC‚Äôs own Grainger College of Engineering. I chose this program in particular because they have a data science track. This will help me keep my skills sharp while continuing my work at General Motors, as well as get a more in depth education in Data Science.</p>
