<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>As of writing this Iâ€™m currently chilling at a boba place while working on the website. Iâ€™m proud to announce that today I have finished the basic career components of the website! I have added this list of materials into the website:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All of my major data science projects that I completed in my last semester at Penn State</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Park Visitation Dashboard</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Machine Learning Research Paper - Comparing Parler/Twitter sentiment prior to January 6th</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Predicting the 2021 Oscars results through movie scores and sentiment scores</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added a statement of purpose to the home page, to let people know what exactly Iâ€™m pursuing in my career and why Iâ€™m pursuing it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Backend support for text to be implemented through posts rather than hardcoded HTML</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability to locally test my website, so I no longer have to commit to github to view my changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The navigation bar is now buttons instead of a bar, which looks much better than the previous version, and looks native to the cayman theme</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Iâ€™m also happy to announce that Iâ€™m currently applying to online masters programs! I already got accepted to John Hopkins Data Science program, so Iâ€™m super excited about getting accepted to more schools and figuring out what the next couple of year will look like!</p>

<p>As for this website I think I can go further in its development and how it can show off my skills. Iâ€™m thinking of making a web application that displays a curated news feed for myself, so that way I have a reason to visit this website every day and can identify typos and issues more quickly across the site.</p>

<p>Till next time!</p>
