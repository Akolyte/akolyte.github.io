<p>Hello! Iâ€™m sorry that I havenâ€™t posted in a long time. There has been a lot going in my life so it completely slipped my mind to continue posting.</p>

<p>For starters, I accepted a position at General Motors (GM) to work as a Software Developer in Warren, Michigan! Itâ€™s a part of the Detroit Metropolitan area, and I could not feel more blessed that at the start of my career I landed in such a great place to grow and learn about working in corporate USA.</p>

<p>With this development, I had to gather all my things and move six and a half hours away from State College. I moved to a spacious aprtment in Royal Oak, Michigan and Iâ€™ve had so much fun getting to meet new people and explore the surrounding area.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve already been working at GM for two and a half months; I swear I just blinked and the time flew by! Iâ€™ll continue to add the documentation from my projects in my last semester at Penn State, and after that Iâ€™ll work on some personal projects that Iâ€™ve wanted to do but didnâ€™t have the time due to school. So be on the lookout for that. Till next time!</p>
