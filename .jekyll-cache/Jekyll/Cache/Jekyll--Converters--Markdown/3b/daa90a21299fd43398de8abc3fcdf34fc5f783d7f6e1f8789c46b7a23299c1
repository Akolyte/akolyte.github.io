I"<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I’m proud to announce today that I have finished the basic career componenets of the website! I have added this list of materials into the website.</p>
<ul>
  <li>All of my major data science projects that I completed in my last semester at Penn State
    <ul>
      <li>Park Visitation Dashboard</li>
      <li>Machine Learning Research Paper - Comparing Parler and Twitter sentiment prior to January 6th</li>
      <li>Predicting the 2021 Oscars results</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Added a statement of purpose to the home page, to let people know what exactly I’m pursuing in my career and why I’m pursuing it</li>
  <li>Backend support for text to be implemented through posts rather than hardcoded HTML on the html side</li>
  <li>The ability to locally test my website, so I no longer have to commit to github to view my changes</li>
  <li>The navigation bar is now buttons instead of a bar, which looks much better than the previous version, and looks native to the cayman theme</li>
</ul>
