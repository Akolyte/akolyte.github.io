<p>Growing up I always had a fascination with technology, and I had many opportunities to engage with that interest through my participation in the Technology Student Assocation (TSA). I also participated in many other extracurriculurs, including piano, taekwondo, boy scouts, cross country, and choir.</p>

<p>These interests eventually lead to my love for programming, and my career in Data Science. After learning more about the domain, I loved the problem solving part of the job (such as fine tuning machine learning techniques, predictive modeling, visualizations, etc.), and I decided that was the career I wanted to pursue.</p>

<p>In May 2021 I graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science from Penn State’s College of Information Sciences and Technology. Along the way I met and got to know many great peers and professors who helped me explore my interests in statistics and data science.</p>

<p>My degree was an “Applied” option of the data science program, meaning that there was a greater focus on building models and applications throughout my coursework. Therefore I have a lot of hands on experience with building data science applications, models, and data cleaning with real-life datasets.</p>

<p>Currently I am working at General Motors as a Software Developer in Warren, Michigan. In my spare time I’m trying my best to go out and get to know lots of new people and work on myself professionally, whether that be through developing this website, or creating applications relevant to my interests in statistical analysis and data science.</p>

<p>Recently picked back up my old hobby playing tennis, and after I save up some money I’m going to try getting back into piano as well!</p>
