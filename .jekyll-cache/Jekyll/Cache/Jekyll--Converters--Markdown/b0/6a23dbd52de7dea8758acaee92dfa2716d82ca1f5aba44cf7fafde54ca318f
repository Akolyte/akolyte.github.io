I"<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>Iâ€™m proud to announce today that I have finished the basic career components of the website! I have added this list of materials into the website.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>All of my major data science projects that I completed in my last semester at Penn State</p>

    <p>Park Visitation Dashboard</p>

    <p>Machine Learning Research Paper - Comparing Parler and Twitter sentiment prior to January 6th</p>

    <p>Predicting the 2021 Oscars results</p>
  </li>
  <li>Added a statement of purpose to the home page, to let people know what exactly Iâ€™m pursuing in my career and why Iâ€™m pursuing it</li>
  <li>Backend support for text to be implemented through posts rather than hardcoded HTML on the html side</li>
  <li>The ability to locally test my website, so I no longer have to commit to github to view my changes</li>
  <li>The navigation bar is now buttons instead of a bar, which looks much better than the previous version, and looks native to the cayman theme</li>
</ol>

<p>Iâ€™m also happy to announce that Iâ€™m currently applying to online masters programs! I already got accepted to John Hopkins Data Science program, so Iâ€™m super excited about getting accepted to more schools and figuring out what the next couple of year will look like!</p>
