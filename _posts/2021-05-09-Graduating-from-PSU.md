Today I graduated from Penn State University with a B.S. in Data Sciences! I am so happy and excited that my journey through my undergraduate degree has come to a close. I'm not sure what the future will hold for me, but for now I am very excited to look at career options and look forward to the coming years in my development as a Data Scientist!
