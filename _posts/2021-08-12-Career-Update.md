Hello! I'm sorry that I haven't posted in a long time. There has been a lot going in my life so it completely slipped my mind to continue posting.

For starters, I accepted a position at General Motors (GM) to work as a Software Developer in Warren, Michigan! It's a part of the Detroit Metropolitan area, and I could not feel more blessed that at the start of my career I landed in such a great place to grow and learn about working in corporate USA.

With this development, I had to gather all my things and move six and a half hours away from State College. I moved to a spacious aprtment in Royal Oak, Michigan and I've had so much fun getting to meet new people and explore the surrounding area. 

I've already been working at GM for two and a half months. Time really flies!
