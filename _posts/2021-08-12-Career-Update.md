Hello! I'm sorry that I haven't posted in a long time. There has been a lot going in my life so it completely slipped my mind to continue posting.

For starters, I accepted a position at General Motors (GM) to work as a Software Developer in Warren, Michigan! It's a part of the Detroit Metropolitan area, and I could not feel more blessed that at the start of my career I landed in such a great place to grow and learn about working in corporate USA.

With this development, I had to gather all my things and move six and a half hours away from State College. I moved to a spacious aprtment in Royal Oak, Michigan and I've had so much fun getting to meet new people and explore the surrounding area.

I've already been working at GM for two and a half months; I swear I just blinked and the time flew by! I'll continue to add the documentation from my projects in my last semester at Penn State, and after that I'll work on some personal projects that I've wanted to do but didn't have the time due to school. So be on the lookout for that. Till next time!
