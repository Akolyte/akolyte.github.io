### Hi, my name is Hojin Ryoo, and I am currently working as a Software Developer for General Motors in Warren, Michigan!

---

I am a first generation Korean American whose parents immigrated from South Korea to pursue their higher education in the United States. I graduated in May 2021 from Penn State University, University Park with a Bachelor of Science in Data Sciences. I then accepted a job offer from General Motors to work as a Software Developer in Warren, Michigan. 

I am interested in the field of data science and statistical analysis, because I enjoy exploring data to discover patterns, as well as coding and development. Data Science checks all these boxes, and that is why I am continuing to pursue that career. 

In the future I would like to eventually become a Senior Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. Therefore, getting a Masterâ€™s in Data Science aligns with that career path and is something I am pursuing. I am interested in machine learning, statistical analysis, business analysis and their applications on gaining insight on topics that I care about, such as U.S. politics, Climate Change, and Economics. I spend a lot of my time consuming content concerning these topics, and I would like to explore them through research under a data science context.
