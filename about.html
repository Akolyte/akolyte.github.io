	<o>Growing up I always had a fascination with technology, and I had many opportunities to engage with that interest through my participation in the Technology Student Assocation (TSA). I also participated in many other extracurriculurs, including piano, taekwondo, boy scouts, cross country, and choir.</o>

	<p>These interests eventually lead to my love for programming, and my career in Data Science. After learning more about the domain, I loved the problem solving part of the job (such as fine tuning machine learning techniques, predictive modeling, visualizations, etc.), and I decided that was the career I wanted to pursue. Now four years later I am currently looking to start my career in Data Science, and I can't wait to get started!</o>

	<p>Currently I am serving as the President of the Penn State Anime Club or PSAO, where we are currently striving to maintain fun and exciting activities in spite of the fact that physical club activities are prohibited by PSU.</p>

	<p>In this oncoming semester I will be working on my capstone project, working together with a local business to come up with a data science related solution to an issue they face. I am also working on a research paper on sentiment analysis comparing Twitter and Parler posts leading up to the insurretion at the capital on January 6th.</p>
