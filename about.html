	<o>Growing up I always had a fascination with technology, and I had many opportunities to engage with that interest through my participation in the Technology Student Assocation (TSA). I also participated in many other extracurriculurs, including piano, taekwondo, boy scouts, cross country, and choir.</o>

	<p>These interests eventually lead to my love for programming, and my career in Data Science. After learning more about the domain, I loved the problem solving part of the job (such as fine tuning machine learning techniques, predictive modeling, visualizations, etc.), and I decided that was the career I wanted to pursue. Now four years later I am currently looking to start my career in Data Science, and I can't wait to get started!</o>

	<p>In May 2021 I graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelor of Science in Data Science. Currently I am working at GM as a Software Developer in Warren, Michigan. In my spare time I'm trying my best to go out and get to know lots of new people. I've recently picked back up my old hobby playing tennis, and after I save up some money I'm going to try getting back into piano as well!</p>
