<div style = "center">
	<p>Currently I am serving as the President of the Penn State Anime Club, where we are currently striving to maintain fun and exciting activities in spite of the fact that physical club activities are prohibited.</p>

	<p>I am also part of an amatuer League of Legends team called Oblivion Esports playing the jungle position. </p>

	<p>In this oncoming semester I will be working on my capstone project, working together with a local business to come up with a data science related solution to an issue they face.</p>
